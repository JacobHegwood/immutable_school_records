# A Web 3.0 App for Educational Records

This app is aimed at proving that immutible educational records are feasible and will be useful in the future by employers, educational institutions, and other merit-based organizations.

## Why is this important?

This transfers the trust of schools to the immutable blockchain as a way of allowing students and schools to grab a trustworthy transcript without middlemen. Educational records are also typically vague and difficult to verify, so this platform can provide a way of verifying the authenticity of the records. The records will include the student's information, the school's information, and the transcript. There will also be descriptions and links to instructor records for each course.
